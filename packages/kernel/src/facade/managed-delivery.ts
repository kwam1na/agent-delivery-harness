/**
 * The facade module's V-slice: ONE typed operation surface over the walking
 * skeleton's modules — accept an already-scoped contract, bind the
 * host-supplied workspace, drive the checkpoint path, and reconstruct
 * status/resume from durable state — with every mutation-capable operation
 * passing the canonical rechecks (product trust, registering installation and
 * active profile, projection digest) before it touches the journal.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FACADE NEVER DOES: launch a coding agent, schedule a subagent,
 * create or delete a worktree, or advance a checkpoint from a host-activity
 * observation. Worktrees are host-created and handed in; the only processes
 * the facade runs — git plumbing and the trusted-base sensor — go through the
 * injected exec port so the scenario sensor can assert the complete launch
 * inventory.
 *
 * CONFIRMATIONS. Contract confirmation and takeover authorization are
 * operator confirmations: excluded from every execution grant, denied by the
 * interceptor, and served only by this facade's channel. The walking skeleton
 * runs under the composition's `confirmation-fixture` profile — valid only in
 * disposable-repository qualification runs and production-rejected by the
 * installer — where the binding renders the challenge into the
 * installation-scoped confirmation channel file instead of an interactive
 * display. Echo evaluation still runs the frozen model-external decision:
 * a model-visible surface, a closed channel, a consumed or expired challenge,
 * or a wrong echo refuses exactly as in production.
 *
 * RESUME. Graceful SessionEnd evidence can report honest `paused`, but this
 * host is currently graded Tier 0 because production has no qualified
 * pre-registration confirmation producer. The confirmation fixture proves
 * fresh-worktree takeover semantics, including fence, revision, and target
 * commit binding; production takeover remains unavailable until the missing
 * producer is qualified.
