/**
 * The submission flow: spec §8.3, from a manifest on disk to published records.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR. The validator answers "is this manifest internally
 * coherent, and does it agree with the candidate observation I was handed".
 * That is a judgement about a value. Submission is a judgement about the
 * *world*: the candidate as it is right now, the run root this harness
 * allocated, the bytes actually sitting in it, and a store that may already
 * hold a record under this identity. Those five SUB rules exist because the
 * transport is part of the trust model — a provider that could choose its own
 * run root, or submit against a candidate it prepared an hour ago, would make
 * every downstream guarantee decorative.
 *
 * THE ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER.
 *
 *   1. Read the manifest through the fs port.
 *   2. When a provider caller supplies its allocated attempt, bind that one
 *      snapshot to the expected provider, run, and run root.
 *   3. Re-capture the candidate through the injected port (SUB-1, SUB-2).
 *   4. Require a current preparation receipt for that candidate — the
 *      preparation receipt's ordering mechanism.
 *   5. Derive the run root from the provider coordinates, and observe every
 *      declared artifact inside it (ENV-10's realpath clause, ENV-11).
 *   6. Validate the manifest, handing it the re-captured candidate and the
 *      artifact bytes read in step 5.
 *   7. Aggregate: the validator's rejections and this module's, in one
 *      response (SUB-5), with no record written if there is a single one
 *      (GEN-3).
 *   8. Publish one record per claim, stamped with the manifest digest (SUB-4).
 *
 * Capture precedes the receipt check because the receipt is evaluated *against*
 * a candidate: there is nothing to compare a receipt to until something has
 * been observed. The receipt check precedes everything else because a stale
 * receipt means the wiring or the tree that produced this candidate is not the
 * one in front of us, and validating a manifest against it would answer a
 * question nobody asked.
 *
 * NO RECEIPT IS A BLOCKER, NEVER A BYPASS. A missing, invalid, wiring-mismatched
 * or stale receipt ends the submission with the receipt's own typed blockers.
 * There is deliberately no option to skip the check and no code path that
 * substitutes the captured candidate for a receipt: the ordering is a mechanism
 * precisely because there is nothing else to consult.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DECIDED HERE. Whether an obligation is *satisfied* — that is the
 * gate's question, asked later against the records this writes. This module
 * accepts or rejects a submission; it never resolves an obligation, and it
 * never reads a clock. Freshness in this system is content identity (GEN-5),
 * and `recordedAt` is data whose grammar the validator checks and whose value
 * nothing consults.

 * The distinction decides whether a refusal may be skipped. A `runId` of
 * `"../run-a"` or `"."` never reaches the filesystem, and skipping the
 * run-root rules for it loses nothing: the submission is already rejected for
 * the id, and emitting `manifest_outside_run_root` for a run root that was
 * never allocated would claim a containment check that could not be performed.
 *
 * Every other refusal is the opposite case. An over-long provider id is legal
 * under ENV-1 and a planted run root is legal everywhere — nothing else in the
 * system rejects either — so skipping there would accept a submission whose
 * containment and artifact digests were never checked at all. Those fail
 * closed, as blockers: there is no manifest rule for "the harness's own
 * directory is not its own", and inventing one would put a spec code on a check
 * that did not happen.

 * the authority on *whether* a record may be written, and nothing here replaces
 * it — but it is an authority over one record, and GEN-3 is a claim about a
 * whole submission.
 *
 * So conflicts are looked for across every claim first, and publication starts
 * only once none was found. That makes the ordinary case atomic. It does not
 * make the concurrent case atomic: two submissions for the same provider run
 * can both preflight clean, and the one that reaches a taken slot second is
 * rejected with its earlier claims already linked into place. The store closes
 * *detection* of that collision, not the atomicity of the submission that lost
 * it.
 *
 * The rollback is what closes the rest. A rejection undoes the records this
 * submission published — only those it created, never one it found already
 * there, which belongs to whoever wrote it — so a rejected submission leaves
 * the store as it found it. What remains uncovered is a crash between the two,
 * which leaves records with no submission to speak for them; that is the record
 * store's own orphan story and not something a caller can close from here.
