/**
 * The admission adapter: the effectful seam between the store, the classified
 * execution context, the caller-supplied live results, and the *pure* gate
 * evaluator.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT IN THE EVALUATOR. `evaluateGate` is a total
 * function of values — it opens no file, runs no git, and reads no clock. That
 * is what lets it be exercised as a decision table. But something has to turn a
 * repository into those values: capture the candidate, resolve the git-private
 * store, read the records filed under each obligation, map the store's
 * quarantine into the evaluator's diagnostic union, and translate the classified
 * context. That is this module, and the purity sensor's d2 rule holds it to the
 * bargain — every filesystem effect it performs is routed through `records.ts`
 * or `preparation.ts` (each of which owns its own fs), never a direct `node:fs`.
 *
 * THE ORDER, AND WHY IT IS THIS ORDER.
 *
 *   1. Capture the candidate through the injected port. Everything downstream is
 *      about *this* candidate, so there is nothing to do until one is observed.
 *   2. Prove capture and store name the same workspace. The adapter both
 *      assembles the candidate binding and synthesizes waiver records filed
 *      under the store's workspace id; if those two workspaces disagreed, a
 *      waiver would be filed where the candidate does not live and still pass
 *      the freshness comparison, which is exactly the silent hazard the recorder
 *      flagged for "the CLI". This is the place that can see both, so this is the
 *      place that asserts it.
 *   3. Require a current preparation receipt. No receipt is a blocker, never a
 *      bypass — and it is decided before the gate runs, so a missing receipt can
 *      never reach a waiver prompt.
 *   4. Project activation, read the store, evaluate.
 *   5. Two-pass waiver, only if the first pass blocked on nothing but waivable
 *      findings and the run is an interactive human with a prompt wired.
 *
 * appliesToCandidate IS DECIDED HERE. The evaluator judges freshness, but it is
 * the adapter that decides which discovered records are even *about* this
 * candidate. A well-formed record whose binding is not fresh for the candidate
 * under evaluation is excluded — it resolves as absent, not as stale evidence,
 * because a record for another candidate is not this candidate's stale evidence,
 * it is simply not its evidence. A quarantined file is the opposite case: its
 * binding cannot be parsed, so it cannot be shown to belong to another
 * candidate, and the fail-closed reading is that it applies (a store that cannot
 * account for its own contents is a gate decision).
 *
 * THE TWO-PASS WAIVER EVALUATION. A blocked first pass whose every finding an
 * interactive human may waive earns exactly one prompt, naming every obligation
 * that one "yes" covers. On acceptance the candidate is re-captured — a change
 * while the prompt was open voids the offer — and then invocation-scope waiver
 * records are written to disk and the gate is evaluated a second time, with
 * those record ids handed in as this invocation's grants. The write happens only
 * after an accepted prompt and a clean re-capture, so a decline or a drift
 * leaves the store exactly as it found it: zero waiver records.
 *
 * WHAT THE PORT FROM ATHENA DROPPED. Athena's admission wrote gate-decision
 * telemetry events, spawned the private validation providers, and mapped two
 * Athena-only providers (documentation and delivery-run telemetry). None of
 * those is in v1 scope — the gate admits and never spawns (Scope Boundaries),
 * there is no decision-event stream, and providers are config data. And Athena's
 * `toEvaluatorContext` remapped the classifier's kinds onto the evaluator's;
 * here `context.ts` already emits the evaluator's `ExecutionContext` union, so
 * the translation is the identity and the classified context is consumed
 * directly. Athena's `invocation:`-prefixed waiver ids are likewise gone: a
 * content-addressed id cannot carry a prefix, so this invocation's grants are
 * named explicitly through `invocationWaiverRecordIds` instead.
