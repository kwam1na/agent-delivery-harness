/**
 * The harness configuration: one object, injected everywhere, validated once.
 *
 * Nothing in the kernel reaches for ambient policy. Every dimension a module
 * needs — which gate this is, which specs it accepts, which paths are narration,
 * which finding codes a human may waive — arrives as a parameter, and the
 * import-boundary sensor enforces that no kernel module imports a config module
 * by name. `defineHarnessConfig` is the one door into that object.
 *
 * WHY THE INVARIANTS LIVE HERE. A config is policy, and inconsistent policy is
 * not a runtime surprise to be discovered at the gate — it is a defect the
 * author should learn about while editing the file. So the rules that relate one
 * member to another (a waiver flag that contradicts the resolution kinds it
 * governs, a delivery-record path the identity rules would exclude from one set
 * but not the other, a finding code no obligation classifies) are checked at
 * load time, all of them, and reported together. Reporting the first failure
 * only would turn one editing session into five.
 *
 * WHY THE CODE UNIVERSE IS INJECTED. The partition invariant needs to know every
 * finding code an obligation can emit. That universe is the structural registry
 * from the blocker contract plus the finding codes the config's own providers
 * declare — both available here. It is deliberately *not* obtained by importing
 * the validator or the evaluator: the loader must not depend on the modules
 * whose vocabulary it is checking, or the check becomes circular and the
 * validator becomes unable to change without the loader agreeing.
 *
 * PURITY. This module is on the kernel-import allowlist that pure modules draw
 * from, so it must stay pure itself: it imports the blocker contract and nothing
 * else — no filesystem, no process, no clock. Reading a config file from disk is
 * the job of the command surfaces; what happens here is validation of a value
 * that has already been handed over.
 *
 * WHO READS WHAT. Every member below names the module that reads it, because a
 * member nothing reads is dead policy that will drift out of truth unnoticed:
 *
 *   gateId                      evidence record store (record identity + filenames)
 *   baseRef                     candidate capture
 *   storageNamespace            evidence record store, preparation receipts
 *   acceptedEnvelopeSpecs       manifest validator (envelope spec rule)
 *   identityVersions            manifest validator (identity-version rule)
 *   computingIdentityVersion    deliverable identity
 *   reviewNeutral               deliverable identity — the only set that
 *                               excludes entries from the deliverable digest
 *   recordNeutral               deliverable identity — a separate predicate that
 *                               never affects the digest
 *   pathClassification          activation projection
 *   sensitivePaths              activation projection
 *   activationThreshold         activation projection
 *   providers[].findingCodes    this loader's partition invariant, admission adapter
 *   agentEnvSignals             execution-context classification
 *   ciPolicies                  execution-context classification
 *   ciPolicyEnvKey              execution-context classification
 *   preparationWiringPaths      preparation receipts (fingerprint input)
 *   obligations[].activation    activation projection, gate evaluator
 *   obligations[].freshness     gate evaluator
 *   obligations[].providers     gate evaluator, admission adapter
 *   obligations[].acceptedPayloadSpecs
 *                               manifest validator (claim payload rule)
 *   obligations[].allowedResolutionKinds
 *                               gate evaluator
 *   obligations[].humanWaiverAllowed
 *                               gate evaluator, admission adapter
 *   obligations[].minimumAttestationLevel
 *                               this loader's scope invariant; the manifest
 *                               validator becomes the behavioral reader when
 *                               levels above `self` are specified
 *   obligations[].ciDelegationPolicyIds
 *                               gate evaluator
 *   obligations[].remediation   gate evaluator (blocker remediation catalog)
 *   obligations[].waivableCodes / nonWaivableCodes
 *                               gate evaluator, admission adapter
 *   deliveryRecordPath          the record command, the CI verification action
 *   deliveryRecordVerification  the delivery-record verify core only — never the
 *                               gate evaluator, so the local gate can never be
 *                               more permissive than CI
