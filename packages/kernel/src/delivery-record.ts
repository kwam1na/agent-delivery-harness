/**
 * The tracked delivery record — `delivery-record/2` — and the pure verification
 * core the CLI `verify` command and the GitHub Action both call.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. The delivery record is a product-layer
 * projection that lives *outside* the delivery-evidence/1 spec. The git-private
 * evidence store (records.ts) is the gate's evidence; this is the one sanctioned
 * artifact that crosses out of the workspace into the tracked tree, so that a
 * reviewer — and a CI job in a different workspace — can see that a gate was
 * satisfied without re-running it. At L0 it proves process discipline and
 * freshness, not provenance.
 *
 * PRODUCE-ONLY (sensor rule d2). This module BUILDS the record object and its
 * canonical bytes; it never writes them. The CLI `record` command performs the
 * one write, through the artifacts fs port, so the only place in the kernel that
 * opens a file for the submission/record path stays the artifacts port.
 *
 * NO CLOCK (sensor rule e). Nothing here reads a clock or a `recordedAt`: the
 * record's identity is the candidate it attests, never the moment it was
 * written, and its freshness is judged against a recomputed deliverable
 * identity, never against elapsed time.
 *
 * WHY THE RECORD IS NEUTRAL TO ITS OWN PATH. `config.deliveryRecordPath` is
 * required by the config loader to satisfy *both* neutral predicates. Because it
 * is review-neutral, writing it does not change the deliverable identity the
 * record attests — the record cannot invalidate itself. Because it is
 * record-neutral, it is not part of any candidate binding — a candidate is never
 * bound to the presence of its own record. The self-neutrality proof in the test
 * suite is exactly this property, exercised end to end.
