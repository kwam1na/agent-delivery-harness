/**
 * Preparation receipts — the kernel's ordering mechanism.
 *
 * WHAT A RECEIPT IS FOR. Preparation is the point at which a candidate is
 * declared ready to be reviewed. Everything downstream — review context,
 * evidence, admission — is about *that* candidate under *that* wiring, so the
 * receipt is what lets a later step ask whether it is still talking about the
 * same thing. No receipt means no review context and no admission; that is the
 * whole ordering, and it is enforced by there being nothing else to consult.
 *
 * WHAT IT BINDS. The candidate's coordinates, and a `preparationFingerprint`
 * over the harness's own version plus the bytes of every wiring path the config
 * declares. The fingerprint is what makes "the gate itself changed" a distinct
 * answer from "your branch moved": a config edit, a rewritten preparation
 * script or a harness upgrade all invalidate a receipt, and they invalidate it
 * with a class that says so rather than looking like drift.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED ON UNRESOLVABLE WIRING. A declared wiring path that is not a
 * readable file is a typed blocker, never a hashed absence. Hashing "missing"
 * would make deleting a wiring file a *stable* fingerprint input — delete the
 * script, prepare, and the receipt is happily current for a gate whose wiring
 * is not there. The blocker is raised before anything is written, so a failed
 * preparation leaves no receipt at all.
 *
 * WHERE RECEIPTS LIVE. Under the record store's namespace root, in a leaf of
 * their own. The resolver is `records.ts`'s, reused rather than re-derived, and
 * the sharing is deliberate on both sides: receipts inherit the store's
 * git-private, worktree-local, untracked-by-construction placement, and they
 * inherit its `workspaceId` — which is the digest of the *namespace root*, not
 * of a leaf — so a receipt and the evidence recorded after it agree about which
 * workspace they belong to. Deriving a second workspace id here would silently
 * break every cross-leaf comparison built on the first.
 *
 * ONE RECEIPT PER GATE, REPLACED IN PLACE. Records are content-addressed and
 * immutable; a receipt is the opposite — it names the *current* preparation,
 * and preparing again supersedes it. So the file is `<gateId>.json` and
 * publication is an atomic rename rather than the store's `link()`-and-reconcile
 * dance. There is no idempotency question to answer: the second preparation
 * wins on purpose.
 *
 * NO TIMESTAMP. Athena's receipt carried `preparedAt`; this one does not.
 * Nothing here is decided by comparing times — every class is decided by
 * comparing values — and a member no decision reads is a member a later
 * decision will eventually be tempted to read, which is exactly what the
 * spec's clock ban exists to prevent.

 * sensitivity would make a cosmetic config edit read as a wiring change, which
 * is a real answer given for a non-reason.
 *
 * HASHED THROUGH THE CANONICALIZER, not through ad-hoc framing. Each path
 * contributes its own name and its own content digest, and the pairs are
 * digested as a canonical-JSON object. Framing raw file bytes with a NUL
 * separator instead is not injective: `path1\0abc\0path2\0def` reads two ways
 * the moment a wiring file contains a NUL of its own, so two different wirings
 * could produce one fingerprint. Pairing each digest with its declared path
 * also keeps two identical files distinguishable — moving a gate's wiring
 * between declared paths is a wiring change.
 *
 * NO VERSION MEMBER RIDES IN THE INPUT. A receipt this harness cannot read is
 * rejected at the `invalid` step, which is decided before any fingerprint is
 * compared, so a schema version inside the digest would be a second copy of a
 * check that has already run — with bump semantics nothing would define.
 *
 * A path that cannot be read as a file throws. See the module note — a hashed
