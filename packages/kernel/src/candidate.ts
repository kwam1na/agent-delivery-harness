/**
 * Capturing a candidate: what is about to be reviewed, observed stably enough
 * that evidence can be bound to it.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES. Every input here is mutable while it is being read.
 * HEAD moves, the index is written, a base ref is fetched, a build drops a file
 * into the worktree. A capture assembled from readings taken at different
 * moments describes a workspace state that may never have existed, and evidence
 * bound to it would be evidence about nothing. So the observation is taken
 * twice, in full, and accepted only when the two agree — a bracket around every
 * mutable input rather than a lock nobody can take. A repository that will not
 * hold still for two consecutive readings is reported as ambiguous, which is
 * the truthful answer.
 *
 * PREPARED, OR NOTHING. There are exactly two shapes a candidate can have: a
 * clean worktree, where HEAD's tree is the reviewable content, and a staged
 * index, where the author has said which files the change consists of. An
 * unstaged edit or an untracked file is neither, and this module never repairs
 * that by staging anything — `git add` is an authorship decision about what the
 * change *is*, and a gate that made it silently would be deciding the scope of
 * the work it is meant to be checking.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED ON THE BASE. A base ref that does not resolve, or that shares no
 * history with HEAD, is a typed blocker. It is never allowed to become an empty
 * changed set, because an empty changed set is also a legitimate answer — a
 * candidate whose tree already matches its base — and the two would be
 * indistinguishable to the activation threshold. One means "nothing to review";
 * the other means "we cannot tell what there is to review".
 *
 * PROCESS CONTROL. Every git invocation goes through `node:child_process`, with
 * the executable and its arguments as an argv array and no shell in between.
 * There is no wrapper process that can outlive the call, nothing for an
 * argument to be re-parsed by, and the pipes are drained to completion so a
 * verbose command cannot deadlock on a full buffer.
 *
 * THE PURE HALF IS NEXT DOOR. Shapes, classification, projection, activation
 * and drift live in `candidate.types.ts`, which imports no process and no
 * filesystem; this file is only the part that has to talk to git.
