/**
 * The pure gate evaluator: what a candidate's obligations resolve to, and why.
 *
 * SIX OUTCOMES, NEVER INTERCHANGEABLE. Each says something different about how
 * the obligation came to be settled, and collapsing any pair would destroy the
 * only record of that difference:
 *
 *   satisfied_live_fact — a provider result observed for this invocation. In
 *                         v1 these arrive as caller-supplied results; the gate
 *                         never spawns anything.
 *   satisfied_evidence  — a stored record bound to this candidate's identity.
 *   waived              — an interactive human accepted the risk, on an
 *                         obligation whose config allows it, for findings the
 *                         config classifies as waivable.
 *   delegated           — a declared CI policy answers for it, and the run is
 *                         that policy's job.
 *   not_applicable      — the candidate does not activate the obligation.
 *   blocked             — anything else. Never something policy grants.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS DELIVERABLE IDENTITY, AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT IS TRUE.
 * The recorder compares the *enumerated* candidate field set, raw `treeSha`
 * included, because at submission time the raw tree is what was reviewed. At
 * gate time the raw tree is deliberately ignored: writing the delivery record,
 * a solution note, or any other narration moves the tree without moving the
 * reviewable content, and a freshness rule that could not tell those apart
 * would deadlock the very process that satisfies it. Everything else in the
 * tuple stays: identity token, deliverable digest, base ref, base tip, merge
 * base, and workspace. An unknown identity token fails closed — a record that
 * predates the identity, or claims one this config does not accept, is stale
 * rather than a match on absent fields.
 *
 * The leniency has a price, and it is paid here rather than hidden: two records
 * that agree on the deliverable but disagree on the raw tree are two
 * content-addressed ids in one provider run slot. The gate cannot choose
 * between them, so it reports `ambiguous_records` and blocks.
 *
 * NO I/O, NO CLOCK, NO AMBIENT ANYTHING. Records arrive as shapes from
 * `records.types.ts`, the candidate as a shape from `candidate.types.ts`, the
 * environment already classified by `context.ts`. Identity is compared as
 * strings, so `identity.ts` — which runs git — is not imported at all. The
 * purity sensor's d1 rule enforces every part of that by static analysis.
 *
 * `deliveryRecordVerification.baseMovement` IS INVISIBLE HERE, BY DESIGN. It is
 * read by the delivery-record verifier and by nothing else. If the evaluator
 * consulted it, an `"allow"` config would make the local gate more permissive
 * than the Action that re-checks the same record in CI, and a gate that is
 * easier to pass locally than remotely teaches people to skip it. The negative
 * claim is asserted in the tests rather than merely written here.
 *
 * WHAT THE PORT FROM ATHENA DROPPED. Two things, both deliberately:
 *
 *   - The attested-waiver record kind. Athena admits a GitHub-attested waiver
 *     across execution contexts because its adapter has already proven a human
 *     issuer. The standalone record grammar has no attested variant, and the
 *     human-review-process adapter that would produce one is out of v1 scope,
 *     so a waiver here is exactly one thing: an interactive human's decision.
 *   - `preventedCostClass` on the decision. It is registry metadata in Athena
 *     with no counterpart in the config surface, and a member nothing reads is
 *     policy that drifts out of truth unnoticed.
 *
 * AND WHAT IT CANNOT REACH. `evidence_not_green` and
 * `unresolved_actionable_findings` are in the shared structural registry, but a
 * stored record carries no verdict and no finding count to decide them from:
 * a non-green manifest is rejected by the payload validator (RG-1) and never
 * becomes a record at all. They are emitted at acceptance time, not gate time.
 * Configs still classify them, which is correct — the partition is over what an
 * obligation's *universe* contains, not over what one module happens to emit.

// ── Waivers ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The narrowest door in the gate, and the one worth stating as a list of
 * conjunctions rather than as prose. A waiver applies only when *all* of:
 *
 *   - the obligation's config permits waiving it at all;
 *   - the run is an interactive human — never CI, never an agent, never an
 *     anonymous shell. An agent that could waive could waive its own review;
 *   - every pending finding is classified waivable by this obligation. This is
 *     all-or-nothing on purpose: a waiver covering "most of it" is a waiver
 *     whose holder was never told what they were accepting. An unclassified
 *     code counts as non-waivable, which is the fail-closed reading of a
 *     partition the loader should have rejected;
 *   - a waiver record exists that is bound to this candidate and whose scope
 *     covers this invocation. A `durable` record settles a candidate-bound
 *     obligation; a `live` obligation is re-evaluated from scratch every run,
 *     so only a waiver granted *during this invocation* can settle it —
 *     otherwise one "yes" to a missing artifact would silently admit a
 *     different failure, including codes the offer deliberately excluded, on
 *     every later run against the same candidate.
