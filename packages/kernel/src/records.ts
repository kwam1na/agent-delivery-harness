/**
 * The git-private, content-addressed evidence record store.
 *
 * WHERE RECORDS LIVE. Under `git rev-parse --git-path <namespace>` — inside the
 * git directory, never the working tree. Three consequences follow, and all
 * three are the point:
 *
 *   - Records are untracked by construction. Writing one cannot perturb the
 *     deliverable identity the evidence is about, so no neutral-path rule has
 *     to carve out an exception for the store.
 *   - Records are worktree-private. A linked worktree resolves the same
 *     namespace to its own `.git/worktrees/<name>/…` directory, so evidence
 *     produced on one branch is not visible from another checkout of the same
 *     repository. The workspace id is the digest of that directory, which makes
 *     the privacy an identity property rather than a filesystem accident.
 *   - Records do not travel. Nothing here is a distribution format; portability
 *     is what the tracked delivery record and provider signatures are for.
 *
 * WHAT A RECORD IS NAMED. `recordId` is the digest of the spec's SUB-4 identity
 * tuple, and the filename carries the gate, the obligation and that id. Two
 * publications of the same identity therefore collide in the filesystem
 * namespace on purpose: the collision *is* the idempotency-versus-conflict
 * check, delegated to `link()`, which is atomic and which no lock file or
 * advisory convention can improve on.
 *
 * HOW PUBLICATION IS ATOMIC. Write a temporary under a name no reader will
 * serve, fsync it, then `link()` it into place. `link()` either creates the
 * entry or fails `EEXIST`; there is no window in which a reader can observe a
 * half-written record, and no window in which a crash leaves a truncated file
 * where a record belongs. On `EEXIST` the store reads what is already there and
 * decides: identical content is an idempotent success, anything else — including
 * a file it cannot parse — is `record_conflict`.
 *
 * ONE CANONICALIZER. Every digest here goes through `canonical.ts`/`digest.ts`
 * (RFC 8785). The Athena implementation this is ported from sorted object keys
 * with `localeCompare`, which makes a record id depend on the machine's locale;
 * that is not ported, and there is no second canonicalizer in this system.

 * by the one containment check:
 *
 *   - TRAVERSAL. `--git-path` does not normalize, so a namespace like
 *     `foo/../../bar` resolves to a sibling of the git directory — in the main
 *     worktree, that lands in the working tree itself, which is the one place a
 *     store must never be: records would become tracked content and writing
 *     evidence would perturb the identity the evidence is about.
 *   - SHARED STORES. Git roots a fixed set of names — `objects`, `refs`,
 *     `info`, `hooks`, `logs` — in the *common* directory rather than the
 *     per-worktree one. A namespace under any of them therefore resolves
 *     identically from every worktree of the repository, and worktree privacy
 *     would be silently void. From a linked worktree the common directory is
 *     outside `--git-dir`, so the check refuses it.
 *
 * In the main worktree those two directories are the same by construction, so
 * the second case cannot be told apart there by any path comparison. It does
 * not need to be: a store shared by one worktree is not shared, and the moment
 * a second worktree exists the resolution fails closed rather than joining it.
 *
