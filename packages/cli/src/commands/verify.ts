/**
 * `verify` — recompute the deliverable identity and check the tracked record.
 *
 * The command captures the current candidate, derives the candidate-keyed record
 * path from the recomputed deliverable identity (the same exact lookup the
 * Action performs from the PR head), reads and parses the record, and hands it to
 * the pure `verifyDeliveryRecord` core. A missing record names the command that
 * writes it; a failed check surfaces the named drift class. When the base-movement
 * policy is `allow`, a passing check that relaxed base drift names the relaxation.
 *
 * THE RUN-JOURNAL ROW, AND WHY IT IS LOCAL ONLY. `verify` is the one caller
 * that holds both halves of the question "was this candidate journaled": a
 * record binding an exact tree sha, and a repository whose run store it can
 * scan for a journal bound to the same one. So it resolves the row and reports
 * it — and reporting is all it does by default. The row changes no exit code
 * unless the operator asks for that with `--require-run-journal`, a LOCAL
 * opt-in: it is not passed by the GitHub Action, not read by the gate, and not
 * consulted by admission. A run journal is self-attested observability that
 * anything the owner executes can append to, so a delivery that could be
 * admitted or refused on one would be resting its gate on a file its own
 * candidate scripts can write.
 *
 * `--mandated-lens <id>` is the second half of the same opt-in: supplied, the
 * evaluator checks the journal's declared mandated pair against these ids
 * rather than merely checking that it declared two non-empty ones. Repeatable,
 * separate-argument form, and bounded to the run family's own id charset before
 * it reaches the kernel.

  //
  // EVERYTHING THE REMEDIATION NAMES COMES FIRST, BECAUSE A DETAIL IS CUT FROM
  // THE END. A blocker's detail reaches a terminal through `renderBlockers`,
  // which bounds it at 600 characters, so a journal with several warnings
  // pushes whatever is last off the end. Two things must never be the
  // casualty: the line saying none of this blocks admission, because a
  // truncated list of violated constraints with no such line reads as a
  // verdict; and the `missing:` list, because the remediation tells the
  // operator to emit the run events this delivery did not journal and that
  // list is the only place this refusal says which ones. So the identifiers,
  // the missing list and the admission sentence all precede the per-warning
  // reasons, which are the right thing to lose to the cap — the row on stdout,
  // which is written line by line and is not bounded this way, always carries
  // all of them. Inside a warning's own segment the `(a consequence of …)`
  // clause goes before the reason for the same arithmetic: the reason is the
  // long part, so a clause written after it is the first thing the cap
  // destroys. With the clause after the reason it vanished from the
  // reproduction shape once the run id reached 36 characters, and `runId` is
  // accepted up to 128; with it before, it survives at every run id length
  // through 128, as do the missing list and the admission sentence. Two
  // warnings that restate one fact, printed as peers with nothing saying so,
  // are the exact misreading this row exists to prevent.
  //
  // Do not read the 120 as making the whole detail fit. It never does on a
  // journal with more than one warning: the reproduction's two render 733
  // characters at this bound (753 at 130, 813 at 160, and 1045 at 400 and at
  // every larger bound — the longer of its two reasons is 315 characters, so
  // nothing above that is binding) against a 600-character cut, and the later
  // warnings' reasons are lost at every one of them — that is what the
  // unbounded stdout row is for.
  //
  // What 120 buys is narrower than it looks, and the narrowness is the point,
  // because two earlier rounds of this delivery each shipped a confident and
  // wrong statement about this budget. Measured on the reproduction's two
  // warnings at the run id this store actually mints (`run-` + 16 hex = 20
  // characters), the second warning's identifier begins inside the cut — as
  // `round-not-bou…`, 13 of its 25 characters — and at 121 and above it does
  // not. That is the whole of it. The margin is one character: at a 21-
  // character run id, which `isLegalRunId` admits up to 128, it is already
  // gone, and a journal carrying a third warning loses the later segments
  // whatever the bound is. What a larger bound costs is a later warning's own
  // SEGMENT, never its name: the `violations:` list and any `(a consequence
  // of …)` clause naming it are ahead of the cut and survive regardless.

 * moves and a record that disagrees about when the delivery began is describing
 * some other run. `endedAt` must lie inside the journal's span, because the

 * `run.ended` all land later — so equality there would fail on every honest
 * record, while an `endedAt` after the journal's last instant or before its
 * first could not have been read off it at all.
 *
 * WHY A MISS IS NOT A REFUSAL. A journal is self-attested observability that
 * anything the owner executes can append to, and this command runs in CI over
 * checkouts that carry no run store whatever. So the refusal is available only
 * where a journal BINDS this record's candidate — never on whichever run is
