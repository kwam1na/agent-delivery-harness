/**
 * Static import-boundary, env, runtime, purity, and time sensor.
 *
 * Six independently falsifiable rules, all parsed with the TypeScript compiler
 * API (never regex over source text):
 *
 *   a  — kernel modules import nothing from `cli`/`mcp`/`action` and never
 *        import `harness.config`.
 *   b  — no module reads `process.env` while it is being evaluated (import
 *        time). In-function reads are legal. Aliased top-level reads
 *        (`const p = process; p.env.X`) are resolved and rejected. Dynamic
 *        constructs the resolver cannot decide are reported as findings —
 *        never silently skipped.
 *   c  — no `Bun.*` API anywhere. Bun is a supported runtime via the CI matrix,
 *        never a required one.
 *   d1 — true purity. The d1 protected classes (`validator/`, `evaluator.ts`,
 *        `context.ts`) import none of the fs/process/os specifier family and,
 *        within the kernel, import only the enumerated allowlist (plus, for
 *        files in a kernel subdirectory, siblings of that subdirectory).
 *   d2 — no ad-hoc fs. `recorder.ts`, `admission.ts`, `delivery-record.ts` may
 *        not import the fs/process/os family directly; their filesystem work
 *        goes through the `artifacts.ts` fs port (not yet created).
 *   e  — GEN-5 time ban. No `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, or `recordedAt` member
 *        read in the decision paths the spec forbids consulting a clock from.
 *        Four forms are rejected: `x.recordedAt`, `x["recordedAt"]`, a
 *        destructured `recordedAt`, and the member name handed to a reader as a
 *        call argument (`read(m, "recordedAt")`) — the last because a module
 *        that reads every member through one helper never writes any of the
 *        first three, which would leave the rule unfalsifiable exactly where it
 *        matters most. A locally-scoped binding merely named `recordedAt` is
 *        legal; only reading the member is a finding. The one structural read
 *        the grammar needs is registered in TIMESTAMP_READ_EXEMPTIONS, site by
 *        site, and each registration is checked against the tree.
 *
 * `import type` is always legal — a type has no runtime edge. `*.test.ts` files
 * are outside the d1/d2/e scans (tests read fixtures from disk and stub clocks);
 * rules a, b, and c apply to them.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. Most protected files do not exist yet. Every scan root and every
 * protected class is registered below with an explicit status, and the registry
 * is checked against the filesystem on every run: a `present` entry that has
 * vanished and a `pending` entry that has appeared are both findings. A rename
 * or a newly landed unit therefore cannot silently drop coverage. Scan roots
 * must exist and yield at least one source file.
